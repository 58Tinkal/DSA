**High‑Level Summary of the `DSA` Repository**

The repository is a small collection of classic data‑structures and algorithm implementations in C++. It contains five source files.

| File | Purpose / Description |
|------|------------------------|
| **`Binnary_Lifting.cpp`** | Implements binary lifting (also known as “jump pointers”) for fast ancestor queries on a rooted tree. Includes functions to build the DP table (`binary_lifting`), retrieve the *k‑th* ancestor (`getKpar`), and compute the lowest common ancestor (`lca`). |
| **`RangeDigitSum.cpp`** | A digit‑DP solution that computes the sum of all digits for every number in a given range `[l, r]`. Uses a 3‑dimensional memo table `dp[idx][tight][sum]` and a helper `solve` to traverse the digit positions. The `fun` wrapper prepares the lower and upper bounds, runs the DP twice, and returns the difference. |
| **`SegTreeSum.cpp`** | A lazy‑propagation segment tree class (`ST`) for range sum queries and range addition updates. Key methods: <br>• `build` – constructs the tree from an input array. <br>• `update` – adds a value to all elements in a range `[l, r]`. <br>• `query` – returns the sum of a range `[l, r]`. |
| **`dsu.cpp`** | Implements a Disjoint‑Set Union (Union‑Find) data structure with both **union‑by‑rank** and **union‑by‑size** heuristics, plus path compression in `findUPar`. Useful for connectivity queries, Kruskal’s MST, etc. |

### Overall Themes
- **Tree Algorithms:** Binary lifting for LCA queries.
- **Dynamic Programming on Digits:** Range digit‑sum computation.
- **Range Data Structures:** Lazy segment tree for efficient range updates/queries.
- **Union‑Find:** Classic DSU with two union strategies.

### Potential Improvements / Missing Elements
1. **README Expansion:** Provide build instructions, usage examples, and a description of each algorithm.
2. **Header Files / Includes:** The source files lack necessary `#include`s and type definitions (e.g., `using ll = long long;`). Adding them would make the code compile out‑of‑the‑box.
3. **Testing Harness:** Small driver programs or unit tests would help verify correctness.
4. **Consistency:** The file `Binnary_Lifting.cpp` has a typo in the name (“Binnary” → “Binary”). Renaming would improve clarity.
5. **Error Handling:** Functions assume valid inputs (e.g., proper tree structure, non‑negative ranges). Defensive checks could be added.

Overall, the repository serves as a concise reference implementation of several fundamental data‑structure techniques useful for competitive programming and algorithmic practice.
